\usage{
jump_spacing(X_t, theta, Time)
}
\arguments{
\item{X_t}{A \code{p Ã— T} data matrix, where \code{p} is the number of variables and \code{T} is the number of time points.}

\item{theta}{A numeric vector of estimated change points (values in \eqn{1:(T-1)}). No need to include \code{0} or \code{T}.}

\item{Time}{The total number of time points \code{T}. Used to close the final segment.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{jump_magnitudes}{A numeric vector of spectral norms of covariance differences between adjacent segments.}
\item{min_jump}{The minimum jump magnitude.}
\item{max_jump}{The maximum jump magnitude.}
\item{spacings}{A numeric vector of segment lengths between adjacent change points.}
\item{min_spacing}{The minimum segment length.}
}
}
\description{
Computes the operator norm of changes in covariance structure between adjacent time segments,
as well as the spacing (length) between estimated change points.
}
\details{
The function divides the series into segments using the supplied change points \code{theta}, then computes
the empirical covariance matrix within each segment. The spectral norm of the difference between successive
covariances is recorded as a measure of "jump" across change points. Segment spacings are defined as the
number of time points between consecutive change points.
