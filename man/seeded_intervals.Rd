\title{Generate Seeded Intervals}
\usage{
seeded_intervals(n, a = (1/2)^(1), minl = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{An integer specifying the total length of the time series. Must be at least 3.}

\item{a}{A decay parameter controlling the geometric scaling of intervals. Must be in \eqn{[1/2, 1)}.
Default is \eqn{(1/2)^1 = 0.5}.}

\item{minl}{An integer specifying the minimum allowed length of any interval. Default is 2.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns \code{st} (start index) and \code{ed} (end index) for each interval.
The intervals are sorted in increasing order of \code{st} and \code{ed}, and duplicates are removed.
}
\description{
Constructs a collection of overlapping intervals of varying lengths across a time series,
used to scan for potential change points. The intervals decay in size geometrically,
ensuring coverage at multiple resolutions.
}
\details{
The intervals are generated at multiple resolution levels indexed by \eqn{k}, with resolution increasing
(i.e., interval size decreasing) as \eqn{k} increases. For each level, \eqn{2m - 1} intervals are placed,
where \eqn{m = \lceil (1/a)^{k - 1} \rceil}. The width of intervals is controlled by the decay rate \code{a}.

The first interval always spans the full series \eqn{[0, n]}.
