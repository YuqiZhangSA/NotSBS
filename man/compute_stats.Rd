\title{Compute Simulation Statistics for change point Detection}
\usage{
compute_stats(
  Time,
  theta,
  detected_cp_list,
  trim = NULL,
  num_simulations,
  method_name
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Time}{An integer specifying the time series length.}

\item{theta}{A numeric vector of true change point locations.}

\item{detected_cp_list}{A list of numeric vectors, where each vector contains estimated change points for a simulation run.}

\item{trim}{A non-negative numeric value for the zone tolerance in \code{\link{align_change_points}}. Usually \code{trim = log(Time)}.}

\item{num_simulations}{An integer giving the number of simulation runs (should match \code{length(detected_cp_list)}).}

\item{method_name}{A character string for labelling the output (e.g., the name of the detection method).}
}
\value{
A list of numeric vectors (length = number of true change points), where each element contains
the aligned deviations between detected and true change points across simulations.
}
\description{
Evaluates accuracy and deviation metrics of estimated change points across multiple simulations,
comparing them against true changes.
}
\details{
For each true change point, the function uses \code{\link{align_change_points}} to match the closest
estimated point (within a tolerance zone) from each simulation. It then:
\itemize{
\item Computes the deviation from truth (signed difference).
\item Calculates detection rate (proportion of simulations with a match).
\item Computes accuracy: whether the deviation falls within \eqn{2 \log(T)}.
\item Summarises frequency of detecting too few or too many change points.
}

Summary statistics are printed to the console, including detection and accuracy rates per change point
and frequencies of \code{m_est - m} values (\code{0}, \code{±1}, \code{≥2}, \code{≤-2}).
